0.75

General Source Changes
----------------------

TESTDRIVERS still enabled (see note for 0.74u2)

Fixed bug in the time accounting for the V60 which was causing Outrunners to run
with flickering sprites and slow music [Aaron Giles]
	src/cpu/v60/v60.c

Fixed another V60 bug introduced in 0.74u2 which broke the v70 games (and further
broke Outrunners) [Kobat, Olivier Galibert]
	src/cpu/v60/v60.c

Fixed some bugs introduced with the timer system changes a while back [Aaron Giles]
	Hopefully this is the last of them.... Fixes Exterminator and the Atari
	polygon games. Hopefully doesn't break anything in the process.

	src/cpuexec.c
	* changed scanline timing to use floor() to get consistent results
	* fixed bug in time computation if requesting a scanline in the next frame

	src/cpu/tms34010/tms34010.c
	* removed 4x executes per loop which screwed up timing
	* fixed internal interrupt generation to get consistent timing results

	src/timer.c
	* now uses the active callback as a base time when adjusting timers outside
	of a CPU context

	src/drivers/harddriv.c
	src/machine/harddriv.c
	* fixed all the games again, but they are slower now due to more necessary
	interleaving

Fixed Dorachan Orientation [Tomasz Slanina]
	src/drivers/dorachan.c
	src/vidhrdw/dorachan.c

Various Fixes [Nathan Woods]
	src/artwork.c:
	src/artwork.h:
	src/common.c:
	- Fixes a screenshot handling bug that affected Space Invaders

	src/cheat.c:
	- Moves the MESS specific code into a separate module, reducing
	#ifdef clutter

	src/harddisk.c:
	- Moved some variable declarations out of for loops so that it
	can compile in non-GCC compilers

	src/cpu/i86/instr86.c:
	- Fixes REP CMPSW so that it uses words and not bytes

	src/cpuintrf.c:
	src/cpuintrf.h:
	- Adds a call cpuintrf_set_dasm_override() that gives drivers
	the ability to customize disassemblies.  This probably isn't very useful
	for MAME, but it is useful for MESS for things like software interrupts
	used for BIOS calls.

	src/windows/config.c:
	- Increases the size of the buffer used when logerror() output
	goes to OutputDebugString()

	src/windows/config.c:
	src/windows/config.h:
	src/windows/winmain.c:
	- Moves config.c externs to a header file
	- Adds another call, cli_rc_create(), which creates MAME's rc
	struct for use elsewhere.  (I'm actually creating a debug time
	consistency check feature for MAME32, to verify at runtime that the
	arguments that MAME32 has are consistent with MAME's).

	src/rc.c:
	- When rc_destroy() is now called, freed pointers to strings and
	files will now be NULLed out.


Overhauled the Canyon Bomber driver with a number of minor fixes like correct
RAM size and VBLANK duration. [Stefan Jokisch]
	- hiscore reset button added
	- sprite positions should be fixed according to the schems
	- language ROM added (i.e. the language dip works now)
	- prototype set renamed from canbprot to canyonp

Improved Super Chase sample loading [sedn]
	src/drivers/superchs.c

Replaced instances of "inline", "static inline", and "static __inline" with
"INLINE".  This fixes some build problems with  xmame and makes things more
consistent. [Lawrence Gold]
	src/cpu/mips/mips.c
	src/vidhrdw/psx.c
	src/machine/psx.c
	src/drivers/namcos2.c
	src/machine/psx.c
	src/vidhrdw/psx.c

Corrected CPU speeds etc. in snowbros.c [The Guru]
	src/drivers/snowbros.c

Reversed inptport.c changes to 0.74u1 as the version in 0.74u2 wasn't correcly
merged, these will need resubmitting

Some namcos22 Improvements [Phil Stroffolino]
	The major things improved are:
	- fixes to display list processing (affects Prop Cycle ending)
	- gouraud shading
	- misc improvements for the not-working games
	src/drivers/namcos22.c
	src/vidhrdw/namcos22.c

Sundance [Stefan Jokisch]
	controls now emulated

	quite slow now but more accurate.
	src/drivers/zac2650.c
	src/vidhrdw/zac2650.c

	src/drivers/cps1.c
	src/vidhrdw/cps1.c
Gorkans [Tomasz Slanina]
	gameplay works but there are no good gfx roms
	src/drivers/pacman.c
Whizz [Tomasz Slanina]

	src/drivers/sidearms.c
	src/vidhrdw/sidearms.c
Marine Date [insideoutboy]
	collisions not emulated + various other issues
	src/drivers/marinedt.c


0.74u2

General Source Changes
----------------------

The TESTDRIVER system has been removed, all drivers are now enabled working or not,
this decision was made by several members of the development team.  The drivers
that were previously TESTDRIVERS are still marked as GAME_NOT_WORKING so can be
filtered out easily with a front-end.  Please note, the enabling of these drivers
does not indicate they're any closer to working than when they were first added
and in many cases it could still be several years before they work depending on
when they're worked on and how difficult they prove to be.  We're always looking
for talented programmers to work on and improve Mame, some of these drivers could
be a good place to start (others may be near impossible to fix)

If any GAME_NOT_WORKING flags have been missed let us know at Mametesters
