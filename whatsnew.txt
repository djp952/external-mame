0.76

It appears no new timer system related bugs were found with 0.75u1 so *hopefully* this
release will be better than the last, 0.75 ended up not being not too great due to the
problems with the YM2151 sound etc.

General Source Changes
----------------------

Various ST-V and SH-2 improvements, shienryu is improved as are many other games but
no more are really playable yet (although I have changed Shienryu to IMPERFECT_GFX
instead of NOT_WORKING as it seems ok, just the sprites are black)

0.75u1

Please TEST this release, I had hoped 0.75 would be the end of the timer related bugs
for good but it wasn't so if this tests out as ok then I'll probably release 0.76
within a fairly short period of time, if sound has vanished on any games, or anything
that booted in .75 no longer boots let us know, the sooner the better.
