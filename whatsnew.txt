0.69

Mainly a bugfix release for problems discovered with new features in 0.68,
it also further clears the backlog.  Put together by David Haywood, 

If you submit changes please make sure they're up to date with the latest
source code, if not it means more work for us in sorting them out.

Several people have asked about the SHA1Merger program for updating their
own drivers, if you need this it should be on www.mame.net within a few
hours of this release.

Note, we are aware of some problems with the Direct 3D core which cause
some games to function incorrectly (Rolling Thunder title screen, Hard
Drivin' Dashboard, Puyo Puyo title screen raster etc.) if you have problems
with games when using -d3d try them without before reporting a bug. (although
please do report games broken with -d3d if you find them but make sure to
specify the problem is with -d3d)

The cause of this problem seems to lie somewhere in

result = IDirect3D7_CreateDevice(d3d7, &IID_IDirect3DHALDevice, back_surface, &d3d_device7);

however we don't know how to fix this nor why it happens, could the real problem
be elsewhere?

Various changes [Nathan Woods]

	src/cheat.c:
	- Minor change to the MESS specific code

	src/datafile.c:
	- DriverDataCompareFunc() is now declared with CLIB_DECL

	src/hash.c:
	- Removed strupr() in favor a manual implementation, because it

	src/windows/rc.h:
	- Fixed a potential crash that could occur if the last line in
	an INI file was not terminated with a CRLF
	- Added osd_rc_write(); which does the reverse as osd_rc_read()
	(this is only used in the MESS Win32 port)

	- Fixes some macros with arguments not used. Otherwise it doesn't compile
	  with gcc 2.95.3.

Auditing Fixes for cases where no good dump is known but a file is found [BUT]
	src\audit.c
	
Improvements and Bug Fixes to the Direct 3D Blitting [Leon van Rooij]

	-effect same as 0.68 and earlier, no effect on d3d module
	-zoom or -z (default is 2) select zoom level, works for the ddraw code as well
	find the smallest display mode that will fit an n times zoomed game image
	(only used when no display mode is explicitly forced,
	the d3d code takes the aspect ratio into account, ddraw behaviour is 
	unchanged)
	-cleanstretch or -cs only strecth to integer ratios, works for the ddraw 
	code as well

	-d3dfilter or -d3dflt select filtering algorithm
	0 is none, 1 bi-linear, 2 flat bi-cubic, 3 gaussian bicubic, 4 anisotropic
	-d3deffect behaves exactly the same as -effect, but only affects the d3d module
	You can use all -effect parameters, so none, scan25, scan50, scan75,
	rgb16, rgb6, rgb4, rgb3, and sharp work, they are identical at 2x zoom
	scan75v and rgb4v also work, and are identical to scan75 adn rgb4
	(as the d3d effects are automatically rotated already)
	Additionally, all effects presets and auto work
	none affects only the presets now.
	The presets are renamed, in addition to the -effect presets, they are now:
	rgbminmask,
	dotmedmask,
	rgbmedmask,
	rgbmicro
	rgbtiny
	aperturegrille,
	dotmedbright,
	rgbmaxbright

	-d3dscan scanline intensity, 100 is off
	-d3dfeedback feedback intensity, 0 is off
	-d3dsaturate oversaturation intensity, 0 is off
	-d3dprescale AKA sharp.
	-d3dcustom custom preset, as before
	(anyone who wants to customise presets can, everybody else should ignore it)
	-d3dexpert Normal users should not use this one, basically if you can't 
	read the
	source to figure out what it does, you have no business using it <g>
	Behaves as -effect did in the previous updates, plus some new stuff;
	disable disables all effects,
	prescale lets you control prescale explicitly,
	pixelcounter changes the scanline texture
	(use mame whatever -z 4 -d3d -cs -flt 0 -d3dexpert pixelcounter),
	norotate disables rotating effects
	
	It has it's own ini section and it handles priorities itself to ensure 
	correct behaviour. For custom presets, patterns are no longer loaded from 
	the effects directory, the name should just include the path.
	
	There are warning messages when you do e.g. -nod3d -d3dscan50, or -d3d 
	-effect sharp (although the latter will work as it has up until 0.68). It 
	tests all hardware capabilities it should (as far as I'm aware, at least). 
	It won't chop textures in 256x256 blocks for old Voodoo cards. 
	-texture_management is now enabled by default as leaving it off seems to 
	have worse consequences for more people than having it on. I haven't added 
	a workaround for cards that can't render to textures yet, other than that, 
	any possible typos, etc. or any suggestions people may have, it should be 
	good for 0.69.
	
	Apparently some videocards don't like the DX7 pageflip in combination with 
	a triple buffer. (behaviour when triple buffering is unchanged from 0.67, 
	that goes for the d3d code as well as the ddraw code).

	src\vidhrdw\brkthru.c

Fixed a bug with -crconly which could cause options.debug_width to become
corrupt [Paul Priest]

Fixed a problem where a NODUMP rom was reported as found even if it didn't
exist in the rompaths [HobbesAtPlay]
	src\fileio.c

Corrected Colours in Progres & added 3rd Button for Aiming [Uki]
	src\drivers\timelimt.c

Fixed Interrupt being triggered on Non-Existant CPU for TaitoSJ games with no
MCU [Aaron Giles]
	src\machine\taitosj.c
	
Added -bios option [Paul Priest]

Adds the system option "bios". An integer that is valid where: 0 <= n < 15

	Rom loading is now modified so that if any of the 4 bits in
	ROM_BIOSFLAGSMASK of the rom flags are set, it will only be loaded if
	the value+1 == options.bios

	NeoGeo has been modified to take advantage of this as follows:
	0 - "sp-s2.sp1"    - Europe, 1 Slot (also been seen on a 4 slot) (default)
	1 - "sp-s.sp1"     - Europe, 4 Slot
	2 - "usa_2slt.bin" - US, 2 Slot
	3 - "sp-e.sp1"     - US, 6 Slot (V5?)
	4 - "asia-s3.sp1"  - Asia S3 Ver 6
	5 - "vs-bios.rom"  - Japan, Ver 6 VS Bios
	6 - "sp-j2.rom"    - Japan, Older
	
	Note that using a value >6 and <15 will result in NO bios rom being
	loaded (And a red screen in NeoGeo's case).

when launching missiles(yamato37b9gre);also fixed crashes in clone
yamato2. [Angelo Salese]
	src\drivers\yamato.c

Removed NeoGeo Memory Card Manager RESET / CALL option from UI, this feature is
only available on the AES console and should be in Mess (and probably won't be
needed at all with a real AES bios) []
	src\ui_text.c
	src\ui_text.h
	src\usrintrf.c

Changed NeoGeo Framerate to 59fps based on Mametesters report about Kof98 Intro Sync

	src\drivers\neogeo.c

Fixed FM bug causing bad sounds in maglord and other games which was introduced in
the last release [Jarek Burczynski]

Discrete Sound update for several games [Derrick Renaud]

	- Atari Baseball - added video invert (triples/home runs).
	- Avalanche - changed to discrete sounds adding missing top rocks sound
	(Aud0 trigger). (and yes the game is supposed to sound horrible)
	- Dominos - added 60Hz ac signal (but it does not seem to affect anything).
	- Drag Race - added discrete sounds.
	- Night Driver - added discrete sounds and video invert during crash.
	Motor/skid sounds are not 100% correct.
	- Sprint 2 - switched player controls so they lined up under the proper
	score color.
	- Orbit - added discrete sounds.

	- [but] fixed the 'no stereo' bug in src\sound\discrete.c
	- I also fixed a minor bug in src\sound\discrete.h causing
	DISCRETE_LOGIC_INVERT not to work.
	- And did minor code cleanup to Basketball.
	- Removed GAME_IMPERFECT_SOUND flag from Circus.  If correct samples are
	used then it is ok, like all sample games.  (New accurate samples have been
	posted at twisty's)
