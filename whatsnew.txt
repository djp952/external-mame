0.53

We have abandoned the "beta" numbering scheme, which was becoming pointless.
The current version is 0.53 because 0.36 (the last "non-beta" release) + .16
(the number of "beta" releases since then) = 0.52.

Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- The Windows port is now called "MAME" (instead of "MAMEW"). The DOS port is
  called "DMAME".

- [Windows] CLI improvements:
  * config option for steadykey (default: OFF)
  * parse debug.ini in debug builds
  * mamew \anywhere\roms\pacman.zip works
  * improved -log option
  * mame will now parse argv[0].ini instead of mame.ini.
    i.e. if the mame executable is called "m37b17.exe" it will
    parse m37b17.ini instead of mame.ini

  Turbografix interface. [Aley Keprt]


Source:
-------

- Big changes to the palette system. 8-bit modes are no longer supported, only
  16-bit ones are used. 8-bit support may be removed from the OS dependant
  code; the core will never ask for an 8-bit deep screen. 8-bit bitmaps could
  still be used though.

- Palette compression has been removed. palette_recalc(), palette_transparent_pen
  and palette_used_colors[] are not available anymore. Drivers that relied on
  PALETTE_COLOR_TRANSPARENT for transparency effects must be rewritten to
  implement them differently. As a result of this, all games using the Taito
  TC0480SCP video chip, and all Taito F3 games, are broken in this release.

- tilemap_update() is gone. Everything is handled by tilemap_draw().

- IMPORTANT CHANGE FOR PORTERS: the OS dependant code is now required to
  guarantee, in 16-bit palettized mode, that Machine->pens[i] == i. The "pens"
  argument to osd_allocate_colors() will be NULL, actually it has been renamed
  "rgb_components" since direct RGB modes are the only ones that will pass that
  argument.

- Remove VIDEO_MODIFIES_PALETTE and the "modifiable" parameter from
  osd_allocate_colors().

- New flags VIDEO_HAS_SHADOWS and VIDEO_HAS_HIGHLIGHTS that automatically extend
  the palette creating a darker(brighter copy for shadows handling.
  palette_set_shadow_factor() and palette_set_highlight_factor() allow to
  control the adjustment to apply (shadow can be > 1.0, making it an highlight,
  and highlight can be < 1.0 making it a shadow - the names are just conventional).
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- New function palette_set_brightness(), allowing selective control of palette
  brightness independently of the palette RAM contents. [Nicola Salmoria]

- MachineDriver.color_table_len can now be 0, meaning that the colortable is a
  1:1 mapping from the palette. Note that you CANNOT use this feature if you use
  TRANSPARENCY_COLOR; but of course, if you need TRANSPARENCY_COLOR you'll not
  have a 1:1 colortable.

- New function tilemap_draw_roz(). [Phil Stroffolino]

- New function auto_malloc(); this is the same as malloc(), but the memory is
  automatically freed when the driver exits. [Aaron Giles]

- osd_bitmap.line is now a void ** to prevent confusion.
