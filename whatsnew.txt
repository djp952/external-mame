Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Fixed (?) collision detection in Thunder Cross. [Eddie Edwards]

- Fixed the VLM5030 emulation (Punch Out, Track & Field, Yie-Ar Kung Fu etc.).
  [Tatsuyuki Satoj]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- [windows] New blitting effect "-effect sharp". This gives a sharper image
  than the default. [Aaron Giles]


Source:
-------

- New macros have been added to declare common callback functions and enforce
  naming conventions. All drivers have been converted to the new macros:

      void init_drivername()            -> DRIVER_INIT( name )
      int generate_int()                -> INTERRUPT_GEN( func )
      void name_init_machine()          -> MACHINE_INIT( name )
      void nvram_handler()              -> NVRAM_HANDLER( name )
      void name_vh_convert_color_prom() -> PALETTE_INIT( name )
      int name_vh_start()               -> VIDEO_START( name )
      void name_vh_stop()               -> VIDEO_STOP( name )
      void name_vh_eof()                -> VIDEO_EOF( name )
      void name_vh_screenrefresh()      -> VIDEO_UPDATE( name )

- Major change to the way machine drivers are set up. A series of macros is
  now available (defined in driver.h) to "build up" a machine driver. The
  ordering of items in the machine driver is arbitrary, apart from CPU-specific
  data, which is tied to the most-recently referenced CPU. With this new format,
  machine drivers can now be built by modifying another machine driver,
  providing a primitive inheritance mechanism. See any driver for an example
  of the new format. See mcr.c for a more complex example of inheritance.

- New functions auto_bitmap_alloc() and auto_bitmap_alloc_depth() are now
  available to create automatically managed bitmaps. Combined with auto_malloc(),
  there is no need for a video_stop function in most cases. All existing
  drivers have been modified to take advantage of these features.

- The old interrupt system has now been made officially obsolete. This means
  that the function cpu_cause_interrupt() is no longer available; you must use
  cpu_set_irq_line() or cpu_set_irq_line_and_vector() instead. It also means
  that a number of old/conflicting constants have been removed. In addition,
  interrupt generation callbacks for CPUs no longer return an IRQ line or
  vector. Instead, the interrupt callback must actively cause the interrupt
  via cpu_set_irq_line(). All existing drivers have been updated to these
  changes.

- New interrupt callback functions: nmi_line_pulse(), nmi_line_assert(),
  irqn_line_hold(), irqn_line_pulse(), irqn_line_assert(). These functions
  replace the old interrupt() and nmi_interrupt() callbacks and can be used
  directly as interrupt callbacks.

- The function tilemap_set_clip() has been removed. In its place, there is a
  new 'cliprect' parameter to tilemap_draw(). All existing drivers have been
  updated to support this change.

- In preparation for partial updating support, the parameters to video_update
  have changed. A new parameter 'cliprect' has been added, which should be
  honored. In the future, the parameter will contain the subset of the screen
  to render; for now, it just contains Machine->visible_area. In addition,
  the 'full_refresh' parameter is gone; update functions must always redraw
  the requested portion of the bitmap. Some drivers have been updated to fully
  support the cliprect; others still need to be updated.

- Two new functions have been added to the timer system. timer_create() creates
  a new "permanent" timer, and timer_adjust() adjusts the scheduling of that
  timer. This is now the only way to dynamically manipulate a timer. The old
  functions timer_set() and timer_pulse() are still around, but they no longer
  return a handle to the timer they create. Timers created with timer_create()
  should be created at initialization time, not dynamically. Timers also now
  participate in the automatic resource tracking, so there is no need to
  explicitly dispose of them. All existing drivers have been updated with the
  necessary changes.

- Basic generic NVRAM handlers have been added. For a number of games, it is
  sufficient to point the global variables 'generic_nvram' and
  'generic_nvram_size' to the location and size of the NVRAM area. In the
  machine driver, you can now specify 'generic_0fill' or 'generic_1fill' to
  request a generic NVRAM handler. The 0fill and 1fill refer to how the memory
  is initialized in the absence of an .nv file.

- The following old functions and macros have now been fully deprecated:

     cpu_get_pc()           -> activecpu_get_pc()
     cpu_get_sp()           -> activecpu_get_sp()
     cpu_getpreviouspc()    -> activecpu_get_previouspc()
     cpu_get_reg()          -> activecpu_get_reg()
     cpu_set_reg()          -> activecpu_set_reg()
     cpu_set_op_base()      -> activecpu_set_op_base()
     cpu_get_pc_byte()      -> activecpu_get_pc_byte()
     READ_WORD              -> (no equivalent)
     WRITE_WORD             -> (no equivalent)

- New function force_partial_update(), call this to force a partial update to
  occur up to and including the specified scanline. [Aaron Giles]

- ARM CPU emulation [Bryan McPhail, Phil Stroffolino]

Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- The Windows port is now called "MAME" (instead of "MAMEW"). The DOS port is
  called "DMAME".

- [Windows] CLI improvements:
  * config option for steadykey (default: OFF)
  * parse debug.ini in debug builds
  * mamew \anywhere\roms\pacman.zip works
  * improved -log option
  * mame will now parse argv[0].ini instead of mame.ini.
    i.e. if the mame executable is called "m37b17.exe" it will
    parse m37b17.ini instead of mame.ini
  [Paul Priest, Bernd Wiebelt]

- [DOS] Support for C64/Atari/Sinclair joysticks connected via DB9 or
  Turbografix interface. [Aley Keprt]


Source:
-------

- Big changes to the palette system. 8-bit modes are no longer supported, only
  16-bit ones are used. 8-bit support may be removed from the OS dependant
  code; the core will never ask for an 8-bit deep screen. 8-bit bitmaps could
  still be used though.

- Palette compression has been removed. palette_recalc(), palette_transparent_pen
  and palette_used_colors[] are not available anymore. Drivers that relied on
  PALETTE_COLOR_TRANSPARENT for transparency effects must be rewritten to
  implement them differently.

- tilemap_update() is gone. Everything is handled by tilemap_draw().

- IMPORTANT CHANGE FOR PORTERS: the OS dependant code is now required to
  guarantee, in 16-bit palettized mode, that Machine->pens[i] == i. The "pens"
  argument to osd_allocate_colors() will be NULL, actually it has been renamed
  "rgb_components" since direct RGB modes are the only ones that will pass that
  argument.

- Remove VIDEO_MODIFIES_PALETTE and the "modifiable" parameter from
  osd_allocate_colors().

- New flags VIDEO_HAS_SHADOWS and VIDEO_HAS_HIGHLIGHTS that automatically extend
  the palette creating a darker(brighter copy for shadows handling.
  palette_set_shadow_factor() and palette_set_highlight_factor() allow to
  control the adjustment to apply (shadow can be > 1.0, making it an highlight,
  and highlight can be < 1.0 making it a shadow - the names are just conventional).
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- New function palette_set_brightness(), allowing selective control of palette
  brightness independently of the palette RAM contents. [Nicola Salmoria]

- MachineDriver.color_table_len can now be 0, meaning that the colortable is a
  1:1 mapping from the palette. Note that you CANNOT use this feature if you use
  TRANSPARENCY_COLOR; but of course, if you need TRANSPARENCY_COLOR you'll not
  have a 1:1 colortable.

- New function tilemap_draw_roz(). [Phil Stroffolino]

- New function auto_malloc(); this is the same as malloc(), but the memory is
  automatically freed when the driver exits. [Aaron Giles]

- osd_bitmap.line is now a void ** to prevent confusion.
